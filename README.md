# EasyCalc
Second project on WPF. Done with a one-day time constraint, so bugs and shortcomings are possible. However, I spent a lot of time playing with the design. Whether it turned out well or not - that's for you to judge.

Installation:
Extract all files into any folder and launch EasyCalc.exe.
